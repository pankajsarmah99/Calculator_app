To test the api of the python that i created , i have download the postman app , after this click to the testAPI and select ApplicationAPI and after this i selct the type of the request POST or GET , in this project i select "POST" request and after this i have give the link of the workspace and the port no followed by the : for ex - " https://orange-accountant-lippx.pwskills.app:5000/postman_method " 5000 is the default port , . In postman select raw data & JSON as a type of the data . In POSTMAN codescript we write the methods and pass the values and send the data , if the API is send succesfully than it will show result in below , this is how we can test our API . Thank YOU
